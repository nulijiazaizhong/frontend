> [!WARNING]  
> This repository will be **DEPRECATED** once ETS2LA C# releases. We're moving to a native framework based on AvaloniaUI. This was my first ever NodeJS project, and the code quality reflects that. If someone wants to resurrect the UI here then you're free to do so. ETS2LA will continue to support 3rd party plugins that can implement their own UIs.
